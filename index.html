		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>	Hello World, Welcome to my Blog. I always wanted to learn myself to create webistes. develop programs and applications, but always had an execuse or decided to play games, watch series and movies etc. So I decided to be more productive and start to learn myself, (since it is never to late to learn something new) to become a web-developer/programmer/designer. As the time goes by I will probably focus on one but for now I am learning the basics of every popular programming language. I have a bit of c and c++ background which I had as subjects in university. This will be my first page and will have refferences to all my work that I have done and will be available on Github or with links provided when using open source templates/code. I will try as far as possible to put comment throughout my code to help anyone to better understand. I am a beginner so the terms and explanation will be from my view and how it works, but will refference if possible for better clarification. 
		</p>
